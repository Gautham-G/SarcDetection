# Sarcasm detection of comments in Reddit.

The goal of this Natural Language project is to perform sarcasm detection on social media data. I make use of comments and replies and provide additional detail in the above .ipynb notebook. The data is taken from the completely balanced SARC dataset (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05579).

Will be updated with different custom models soon!

Current implementations -
1. DistilBERT (Hugging Face) 

Future implementations -
1. ELMo embedded Language models
2. ELMo-emo (novel approach proposed @ Georgia Tech CS 7650 by **Gautham Gururajan**, Vishal H., Vasistha S.)
